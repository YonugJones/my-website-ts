        <h2>Who is Peter?</h2>
        <p>
          Peter Kerfoot (PK) is a front-end web developer with roots in
          acoustical engineering and a steady fascination with design,
          connectivity, and the spaces where logic meets creativity. His journey
          into code was self-taught, driven by curiosity and care.
        </p>
        <p>
          He builds with intentionâ€”seeking clarity, flow, and the small details
          that make interfaces feel human. Beyond the screen, PK spends his time
          playing chess, layering samples and crafting beats, communing with the
          Chicao avian wildlife, and wandering through the echoes of the Three
          Kingdoms era.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you have a project in mind and would like to work together to
          bring it to life or if you just want to chop it up, don't hesitate to
          say hi
